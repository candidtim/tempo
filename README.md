# JIRA Tempo CLI

"Tempo CLI" is a developers' answer to repetitive and boring task of filling in time tracking information in Tempo
JIRA plug-in. For us who already implicitly "track" their activity in Git (bad luck for SVN users), this tool will
attempt to report time based on commit history.


## Status

Work in Progress


## Features

 - log time manually from command line
 - log time based on Git history


## Build

To build, install [Haskell Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html) and use:

    $ stack build
